# Linear MCP Extension - Project Plan

## Overview
Building a Chrome extension with chat interface that connects to Linear via self-hosted MCP server, featuring OAuth authentication, real-time sync, and freemium model.

## Tech Stack
- **Auth**: OAuth with Clerk
- **Database**: Convex (real-time sync)
- **MCP**: Self-hosted server
- **Storage**: Sync across devices
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS (precompiled)
- **Development**: Cursor IDE

## Monetization Model
- **Free Users**: No conversation memory, no command history, no personalization
- **Paid Users**: Full conversation memory, command history, personalization features

## Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication âœ… COMPLETED

### Step 1: Project Setup âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create project directory
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create .gitignore

### Step 2: Project Structure âœ… COMPLETED

```

### Step 3: Self-hosted MCP Server âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize MCP server project
- [x] Install dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, @linear/sdk)
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create Linear API wrapper
- [x] Implement core MCP tools:
  - [x] create-issue.ts
  - [x] search-issues.ts
  - [x] update-issue.ts
  - [x] get-teams.ts
- [x] Test MCP server locally

### Step 4: Convex Database Setup (DEFERRED)
- [ ] Initialize Convex project (Not needed for core functionality)
- [ ] Configure database schema (Will implement in Phase 6)
- [ ] Create Convex functions (Will implement in Phase 6)
- [ ] Set up Clerk integration (Mock auth working, real Clerk deferred)

### Step 5: Clerk Authentication âœ… COMPLETED (Mock Implementation)
- [x] Create mock Clerk authentication flow
- [x] Configure Chrome extension auth handling
- [x] Set up extension auth flow
- [x] Implement user data persistence

### Step 6: Chrome Extension Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create Manifest V3 structure
- [x] Define permissions
- [x] Create popup HTML structure
- [x] Implement chat UI components
- [x] Set up message passing architecture

## UI Components (Based on Provided Image)

### Chat Interface Components:
1. **Header Component**
   - User greeting: "Hi Sam, how can I help you today?"
   - Clean, centered layout

2. **Message Bubbles**
   - User messages: Right-aligned
   - Assistant messages: Left-aligned with avatar
   - Rounded corners, proper spacing

3. **Quick Action Buttons**
   - "What's my burn rate"
   - "What's my runway" 
   - "Show transactions without receipts"
   - "What's my tax summary"
   - Pill-shaped buttons, subtle styling

4. **Input Field**
   - Bottom-positioned
   - "Ask Midday a question..." placeholder
   - Send button with icon
   - Voice input capability

5. **Loading States**
   - Typing indicators
   - Processing states

## Phase 2: MCP Integration Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] MCP Server deployment (local development ready)
